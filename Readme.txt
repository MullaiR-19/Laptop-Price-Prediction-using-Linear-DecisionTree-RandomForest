##Laptop Price Prediction using Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regressor

This project is aimed at predicting the price of a laptop based on its specifications. The dataset used for this project contains information about various laptop features such as processor type, memory, storage, display, and graphics card etc.

The project is implemented using Python and scikit-learn library. Three regression algorithms - Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regressor are used to predict the price of a laptop. 

Linear Regression is a simple algorithm that works well with datasets with linear relationships. It predicts the output based on the linear combination of input variables.

Decision Tree Regression is a powerful algorithm that can handle both linear and non-linear datasets. It works by creating a tree structure that partitions the input space into smaller regions.

Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and stability of the model. It works by creating random subsets of the input data and building decision trees on each subset.

The project is divided into three parts - data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. In the data preprocessing phase, the data is cleaned, and feature engineering is performed to extract meaningful features from the dataset. 

In the model building phase, the algorithms are trained on the preprocessed data, and the best algorithm is selected based on the evaluation metrics.

In the evaluation phase, the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) are calculated to determine the performance of the selected algorithm.

This project is useful for anyone who wants to predict the price of a laptop based on its features. It demonstrates the use of three popular regression algorithms and can be extended to include other algorithms and datasets.

Note: The data have many object in columns which need to be converted to numercic properly bebore processing
